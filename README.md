# Chimera Model with migrations For Covid19

In this repository, we present the necessary codes and results to perform a validation for an already stemated set of parameters using [GSUA_CSB toolbox](https://github.com/drojasd/GSUA-CSB) in Matlab2020a. Also, we used as a study case the COVID-19 real data from two localities: Hubei-China (from January 21 to April 8, 2020) and Colombia (from March 6 to November 11).

The original Model is takem from [1](https://github.com/alexacl95/ChimeraModelForCovid19),
